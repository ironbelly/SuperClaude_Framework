- <CRITICAL> You are only to modify documents within @docs/generated </critical> Before aligning port documentation, validate in a verifiable way which ports are the correct ones and ensure we are aligning with the correct ports.  Before adding anything validate and verify that the component APIs and Typescript interfaces that were missing from teh documentation are not obsolete.

It works with partial code snippets—no need for full file content.

Warp Grep: warp-grep is a subagent that takes in a search string and tries to find relevant context. Best practice is to use it at the beginning of codebase explorations to fast track finding relevant files/lines. Do not use it to pin point keywords, but use it for broader semantic queries. "Find the XYZ flow", "How does XYZ work", "Where is XYZ handled?", "Where is <error message> coming from?"
