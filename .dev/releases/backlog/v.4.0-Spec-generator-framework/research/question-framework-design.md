# Expansive Question Framework Design

## Research Document for Spec Generator v4.0

**Purpose**: A practical framework enabling AI agents to help users develop better, more expansive specifications through strategic questioning

**Research Date**: January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This research synthesizes methodologies for designing question sets that help users expand, improve, and deepen their initial ideas. The framework draws from established practices including Socratic questioning, design thinking, improvisational techniques, and modern AI-powered ideation research.

### Key Findings

1. **Question Types Matter**: Different question categories serve distinct purposes - clarifying, expanding, challenging, connecting, and future-focused questions each unlock different aspects of idea development

2. **Sequencing is Critical**: The order of questions significantly impacts outcomes - funnel (broad-to-specific), diamond (diverge-converge), and spiral (iterative deepening) approaches each serve different contexts

3. **"Yes, And..." Amplification**: Improvisational techniques that build upon rather than judge ideas create psychological safety and generate more creative output

4. **10x Thinking Unlocks Innovation**: Challenging users to think of 10x improvements rather than incremental changes forces creative breakthroughs

5. **AI-Powered Adaptation**: Modern AI can dynamically adjust questioning strategies based on response quality and engagement signals

## 1. Question Taxonomy for Idea Exploration

### 1.1 The Six Types of Socratic Questions

Based on R.W. Paul's framework for critical thinking, these question types form the foundation of effective idea exploration:

| Category | Purpose | Example Questions |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Clarification** | Understand what is meant | "What do you mean by...?" "How does this relate to...?" "Can you give an example?" |
| **Probing Assumptions** | Examine underlying beliefs | "What are you assuming here?" "Why do you think that assumption holds?" |
| **Probing Reasons/Evidence** | Validate thinking | "What evidence supports this?" "How do you know this is true?" |
| **Viewpoints/Perspectives** | Explore alternatives | "What would someone who disagrees say?" "What's another way to look at this?" |
| **Implications/Consequences** | Consider outcomes | "What would happen if...?" "What are the implications of...?" |
| **Questions About the Question** | Meta-examination | "Why is this question important?" "What does this question assume?" |

**Source**: [University of Michigan - Six Types of Socratic Questions](https://websites.umich.edu/~elements/probsolv/strategy/cthinking.htm)

### 1.2 Design Thinking Question Types

From the Interaction Design Foundation and Toptal's design thinking methodology:

| Type | Function | Application |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Explorative** | Force expansion into new areas | "Have you thought of...?" "What if you explored...?" |
| **Affective** | Reveal feelings and emotional responses | "How do you feel about...?" "What excites you about this?" |
| **Reflective** | Encourage deeper elaboration | "What do you think causes...?" "Why do you believe...?" |
| **Probing** | Invite deeper examination | "Can you describe how...?" "Tell me more about..." |
| **Analytical** | Seek root causes | "What are the causes of...?" "What drives this behavior?" |

### 1.3 Brainstorming Question Categories

From Grammarly's research on brainstorming, 20 categories of questions serve different ideation purposes:

**Primary Categories for Spec Generation**:
- **Audience Questions**: Who will use this? What are their needs?
- **Creative Questions**: What bold, unexpected approach could work?
- **Feasibility Questions**: Is this technically possible? What resources are needed?
- **Retrospective Questions**: What can we learn from similar projects?
- **Constraint Questions**: What limitations must we consider?

## 2. Idea Expansion Techniques

### 2.1 "Yes, And..." Methodology

Originating from improv theater (developed by the Compass Players in the 1950s), this technique has proven highly effective for business brainstorming.

**The Two Components**:

1. **"Yes" (Acceptance)**: Acknowledge and validate the contribution without judgment
   - Creates psychological safety
   - Encourages participation
   - Prevents premature editing

2. **"And" (Building)**: Add value by extending the idea
   - Enhances and elevates ideas
   - Creates collaborative momentum
   - Leads to innovative combinations

**Implementation Rules**:
- Separate creation from editing phases
- Trust that teammates will be receptive
- Focus on expansion before evaluation
- Use active listening as the foundation

**Business Benefits**:
- More productive meetings
- Swifter decisions
- Stronger collaboration
- Positive conflict resolution

### 2.2 SCAMPER Technique

Developed by Bob Eberle based on Alex Osborn's work, SCAMPER provides systematic questions for expanding any idea:

| Letter | Category | Key Questions |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **S** | Substitute | What can be replaced? What materials, people, or rules can change? |
| **C** | Combine | How can two or more parts combine? What can merge to create synergy? |
| **A** | Adapt | What can be adapted from elsewhere? What similar solutions exist? |
| **M** | Modify/Magnify/Minify | What can be enlarged or reduced? What can be emphasized differently? |
| **P** | Put to Another Use | What else could this be used for? What other markets or contexts apply? |
| **E** | Eliminate | What can be removed? What's unnecessary? What can be simplified? |
| **R** | Reverse/Rearrange | What if we flip the process? What can be rearranged? |

**Real-World Examples**:
- **LEGO**: Used "Combine" to create the LEGO Movie product line
- **Adidas**: Used "Put to Another Use" to create shoes from recycled ocean waste

### 2.3 10x Thinking

Popularized by Google X and Larry Page, this approach forces radical innovation rather than incremental improvement.

**Core Principle**: Ask "What would it take to make this 10 times better?" instead of "How can we improve by 10%?"

**Why It Works**:
- Removes mental constraints
- Forces questioning of assumptions
- Requires fresh perspectives
- Opens doors to breakthrough solutions

**Application Framework**:
1. **Reframe the Problem**: Look at it from multiple angles
2. **Remove Constraints**: Imagine unlimited resources
3. **Use Multipliers**: Leverage technology, systems, partnerships
4. **Spend 80% on New, 20% on Existing**: Prioritize exploration

**Examples**:
- Google Maps: Instead of "better map," asked "How can we map the entire world with real-time updates?"
- SpaceX: Instead of "better rockets," asked "How can we make rockets fully reusable?"

### 2.4 Starbursting Technique

A visual brainstorming method using the six journalistic questions:

```
        WHO?
          |
   WHY?---*---WHAT?
          |
       WHERE?
        /   \
    WHEN?   HOW?
```

**Application**: Place the idea at the center, then generate questions for each point of the star before attempting to answer them.

## 3. Challenge and Strengthen Methods

### 3.1 Pre-Mortem Analysis

Developed by cognitive psychologist Gary Klein, this technique imagines failure before it happens.

**The Approach**: "Imagine it's 6-12 months from now and this project has failed completely. What went wrong?"

**Key Questions**:
- What are the key assumptions driving this, and what if they prove false?
- What areas might we be overlooking or underestimating?
- Could our actions have unintended negative side effects?
- What potential roadblocks or delays might hinder progress?
- What could prevent successful delivery in the next 90 days?

**Benefits**:
- 30% more successful at identifying reasons for failure
- Reduces overconfidence
- Increases awareness of criticalities
- Enables proactive mitigation

### 3.2 Five Whys Technique

Developed by Sakichi Toyoda (founder of Toyota Industries), this iterative technique explores cause-and-effect relationships.

**Process**:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why?" and write the answer
3. Repeat 3-5 times until root cause emerges

**Example**:
```
Problem: The application is slow
Why? -> The database queries are inefficient
Why? -> We're not using indexes
Why? -> The schema wasn't optimized for these access patterns
Why? -> Requirements changed after initial design
Why? -> We didn't plan for iterative requirements discovery
ROOT CAUSE: Need better requirements elicitation process
```

**Source**: [Wikipedia - Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys), [ASQ - Five Whys and Five Hows](https://asq.org/quality-resources/five-whys)

### 3.3 Assumption Challenging Questions

From the Interaction Design Foundation's Challenge Assumptions method:

**Framework**:
1. Identify key assumptions in the idea
2. For each assumption, ask: "What if this assumption were not true?"
3. Explore where that question leads
4. Generate alternatives based on challenged assumptions

**Example Challenging Questions**:
- "What if users don't behave the way we expect?"
- "What if the technology doesn't scale?"
- "What if the market changes?"
- "What if the opposite approach worked better?"

**Source**: [IxDF - Challenge Assumptions Method](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-challenge-assumptions)

### 3.4 Edge Case Discovery

Critical for software specifications to ensure robustness:

**Key Questions**:
- "What are the edge cases here? What could go wrong?"
- "What happens at the boundaries?" (empty inputs, maximum values, etc.)
- "What unusual inputs might users provide?"
- "What if the user does something unexpected?"

**Real-World Failures from Missing Edge Cases**:
- Therac-25 radiation machine accidents (race condition edge case)
- Microsoft Zune 30GB freeze (leap year edge case)

**Source**: [AlgoCademy - Understanding Edge Cases](https://algocademy.com/blog/understanding-edge-cases-thinking-beyond-the-basics/)

---

## 4. Question Sequencing Strategies

### 4.1 Funnel Approach (Broad to Specific)

The funnel technique starts with broad, open-ended questions and gradually narrows to specific details.

**Structure**:
```
BROAD      [Open-ended exploration]
   \
    \      [Probing questions]
     \
      \    [Specific clarification]
       \
        -> [Targeted details]
```

**Benefits**:
- Avoids influencing user perceptions early
- Prevents leading questions
- Creates comfortable environment
- Uncovers unexpected insights

**Example Sequence**:
1. "Tell me about your vision for this project" (Broad)
2. "What aspects are most important to you?" (Narrowing)
3. "How would users accomplish [specific task]?" (Specific)
4. "What should happen when [specific edge case]?" (Targeted)

**Source**: [NN/g - The Funnel Technique](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-funnel-technique-in-qualitative-user-research/), [Indeed - Funnel Questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/funnel-questions)

### 4.2 Diamond Approach (Diverge then Converge)

Based on the Double Diamond design process developed by the British Design Council in 2005.

**The Four Phases**:

| Phase | Mode | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Discover** | Divergent | Explore possibilities, eliminate assumptions |
| **Define** | Convergent | Analyze findings, focus on key problems |
| **Develop** | Divergent | Brainstorm solutions, "Yes, and..." mindset |
| **Deliver** | Convergent | Test, refine, implement |

**Key Insight**: You cannot successfully diverge and converge simultaneously. Separate the generation of ideas from the selection of ideas.

**Application for Spec Generation**:
1. **Diverge**: Generate all possible features, use cases, user stories
2. **Converge**: Prioritize and select the essential ones
3. **Diverge**: Explore implementation approaches for selected items
4. **Converge**: Define the final specification

**Source**: [David Theil - The Double Diamond](https://david-theil.medium.com/the-double-diamond-a-model-for-divergent-and-convergent-thinking-4c902a546796), [Maze - Double Diamond Design Process](https://maze.co/blog/double-diamond-design-process/)

### 4.3 Spiral Approach (Iterative Deepening)

Each cycle builds upon the previous one, going deeper with each iteration.

**Structure**:
```
Cycle 1: High-level understanding
    |
    v
Cycle 2: More detailed exploration of key areas
    |
    v
Cycle 3: Deep dive into specifics
    |
    v
Cycle 4: Edge cases and exceptions
```

**Application**:
- First pass: "What problem are we solving?"
- Second pass: "What are all the ways to solve it?"
- Third pass: "What's the best approach and why?"
- Fourth pass: "What could go wrong?"

### 4.4 Tree Approach (Branching Exploration)

Explores multiple branches from a central concept, allowing parallel investigation of different aspects.

**Structure**:
```
                    [Core Idea]
                        |
        +---------------+---------------+
        |               |               |
    [Branch 1]     [Branch 2]      [Branch 3]
        |               |               |
    +---+---+       +---+---+       +---+---+
    |       |       |       |       |       |
  [1.1]   [1.2]   [2.1]   [2.2]   [3.1]   [3.2]
```

**Application**: Each branch represents a different aspect (users, features, technology, business model) that can be explored independently.

## 5. AI-Powered Ideation Facilitation

### 5.1 How AI Can Facilitate Brainstorming

Research shows AI can significantly enhance ideation processes:

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Diverse Starting Points**: Generate multiple perspectives users might overlook
- **Counterintuitive Solutions**: Propose approaches human participants might miss
- **Cross-Industry Inspiration**: Suggest solutions from unrelated fields
- **Cognitive Barrier Breaking**: Help overcome mental blocks

**Research Finding**: A study by Wharton professors found that ChatGPT significantly outperformed MBA students in both quantity and quality of idea generation.

### 5.2 Adaptive Questioning Strategies

Modern AI systems can dynamically adjust questioning based on response analysis:

**LSDE Response Quality Metrics** (from AURA framework):
- **Length**: How detailed is the response?
- **Self-disclosure**: How open is the user being?
- **Emotion**: What emotional signals are present?
- **Specificity**: How concrete are the answers?

**Adaptive Behaviors**:
- Skip irrelevant questions based on context
- Identify when respondent is fatigued and adjust complexity
- Prioritize questions that yield most valuable insights
- Generate dynamic follow-up questions based on responses

**Source**: [arXiv - AURA Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.27126), [BlockSurvey - AI-Powered Adaptive Questioning](https://blocksurvey.io/ai-adaptive-questioning)

### 5.3 Best Practices for AI-Facilitated Ideation

**Start with Open-Ended Questions**:
- Broad questions yield diverse perspectives
- Cannot be answered with simple "yes/no"
- Allow respondents to speak freely

**Use AI as a Thinking Partner, Not Oracle**:
- AI generates options for consideration
- Human judgment evaluates and refines
- Consider feasibility, ethics, alignment with values

**Integrate Traditional Methods**:
- Combine AI with mind mapping
- Use AI alongside role-playing exercises
- Pair AI suggestions with design thinking workshops

### 5.4 Research on Chatbot Effectiveness

A study of ~600 participants and 5,200+ responses found that conversational AI chatbots:

- Drove **significantly higher participant engagement**
- Elicited **better quality responses** measured by:
  - Informativeness
  - Relevance
  - Specificity
  - Clarity

### 7.2 Adaptive Response Strategy

**Based on Response Quality**:

| Response Type | AI Action |
|---------------|-----------|
| Vague/Short | Ask for clarification, provide examples |
| Detailed/Comprehensive | Move to expansion questions |
| Uncertain | Offer options, use "Yes, And..." to build |
| Confident but Narrow | Challenge with alternatives, use SCAMPER |
| Overwhelmed | Simplify, use funnel to narrow focus |

### 7.3 Question Bank Structure

```yaml
question_bank:
  discovery:
    vision: [question_templates...]
    users: [question_templates...]
    scope: [question_templates...]

  expansion:
    features: [question_templates...]
    building: [question_templates...]
    scamper: [question_templates...]
    ten_x: [question_templates...]

  challenge:
    assumptions: [question_templates...]
    premortem: [question_templates...]
    edge_cases: [question_templates...]

  connection:
    integration: [question_templates...]
    dependencies: [question_templates...]

  future:
    evolution: [question_templates...]
    success: [question_templates...]
```

### 7.4 Implementation Principles

1. **Start Broad, Go Deep**: Use funnel approach for initial discovery
2. **Build Before Judging**: Apply "Yes, And..." before challenging
3. **Separate Divergence and Convergence**: Never do both simultaneously
4. **Adapt to Responses**: Adjust question type based on user engagement
5. **Challenge After Establishing Trust**: Save hardest questions for after rapport
6. **Close with Future Vision**: End on positive, forward-looking note

### 7.5 Key Success Metrics

Track effectiveness through:
- Number of features discovered vs. initial idea
- Depth of specification (layers of detail)
- Edge cases identified
- User engagement (response length, elaboration)
- Specification completeness score
