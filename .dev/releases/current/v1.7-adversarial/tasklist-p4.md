## Source Snapshot

- Implements `/sc:adversarial`, a generic reusable command for structured adversarial debate, comparison, and merge across 2-10 artifacts
- 5-step protocol: diff analysis → adversarial debate → hybrid scoring & base selection → refactoring plan → merge execution
- Two input modes: Mode A (compare existing files) and Mode B (generate variants from source + agents)
- Configurable debate depth (quick/standard/deep), convergence threshold (default 80%), interactive mode
- Produces 6 artifacts: diff-analysis.md, debate-transcript.md, base-selection.md, refactor-plan.md, merge-log.md, merged output
- 6 milestones (M0-M5) on strictly sequential critical path, 23-33 hours estimated effort

---

## Deterministic Rules Applied

1. **Phase renumbering**: M0-M5 mapped to Phase 1-6 sequentially with no gaps (Section 4.3)
2. **Task ID scheme**: `T<PP>.<TT>` zero-padded, e.g., `T01.03` (Section 4.5)
3. **Checkpoint cadence**: After every 5 tasks within a phase + end of each phase (Section 4.8)
4. **Clarification tasks**: Inserted for genuine tier ambiguity where keyword matches conflict with task semantics (Section 4.6)
5. **Deliverable registry**: Each task declares 1-5 deliverables with D-#### IDs and intended artifact paths (Section 5.1)
6. **Effort mapping**: Deterministic EFFORT_SCORE from text length (≥120 chars: +1), split status (+1), keyword presence (+1), dependency words (+1) → XS/S/M/L/XL (Section 5.2.1)
7. **Risk mapping**: Deterministic RISK_SCORE from security (+2), data (+2), auth (+1), performance (+1), cross-cutting (+1) keywords → Low/Medium/High (Section 5.2.2)
8. **Tier classification**: STRICT > EXEMPT > LIGHT > STANDARD priority, keyword matching + context boosters + compound phrase overrides (Section 5.3)
9. **Verification routing**: Tier-aligned — STRICT: sub-agent, STANDARD: direct test, LIGHT: sanity check, EXEMPT: skip (Section 4.10)
10. **MCP requirements**: Tier-driven tool dependencies per Section 5.5
11. **Traceability matrix**: R-### → T##.## → D-#### → artifact paths → tier → confidence (Section 5.7)
12. **Context normalization**: Task text includes milestone objective + task description for keyword scanning; "implement" and "create" from milestone objectives contribute to STANDARD scoring

## Phase 4: Hybrid Scoring & Base Selection

Implement Step 3 — the hybrid quantitative-qualitative scoring protocol from Appendix A to select the strongest variant as merge base.

### T04.01 — Implement quantitative scoring layer (5 metrics)

**Roadmap Item ID(s):** R-021
**Why:** The quantitative layer provides deterministic, repeatable scoring across 5 metrics that accounts for 50% of the final variant score.
**Effort:** `S`
**Risk:** `Low`
**Risk Drivers:** None matched
**Tier:** `STANDARD`
**Confidence:** `[██████████] 75%`
**Requires Confirmation:** No
**Critical Path Override:** No
**Verification Method:** Direct test execution
**MCP Requirements:** Preferred: Sequential, Context7
**Fallback Allowed:** Yes
**Sub-Agent Delegation:** None
**Deliverable IDs:** D-0024
**Artifacts (Intended Paths):**
- `.roadmaps/v1.7.0/artifacts/D-0024/spec.md`

**Deliverables:**
1. Quantitative scoring engine — implements 5 deterministic metrics: Requirement Coverage (RC, 0.30), Internal Consistency (IC, 0.25), Specificity Ratio (SR, 0.15), Dependency Completeness (DC, 0.15), Section Coverage (SC, 0.15); all normalized to [0.0, 1.0]

**Steps:**
1. **[PLANNING]** Review spec Appendix A.1 quantitative layer in full: 5 metrics, formulas, contradiction detection protocol
2. **[PLANNING]** Design metric computation approach: RC via grep-matching, IC via contradiction scan, SR via statement classifier, DC via reference resolver, SC via section counting
3. **[EXECUTION]** Implement RC: grep-match source requirements against variant text, compute ratio
4. **[EXECUTION]** Implement IC: reuse contradiction detection (T02.05), compute 1 - (contradictions/claims)
5. **[EXECUTION]** Implement SR: classify statements as concrete (numbers, dates, names) vs. vague ("appropriate", "as needed")
6. **[EXECUTION]** Implement DC: resolve internal references (section refs, milestone refs), compute ratio of resolved to total
7. **[EXECUTION]** Implement SC: count top-level sections, normalize against max across variants
8. **[VERIFICATION]** Run twice on same inputs — verify identical scores (determinism test)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 5 metrics implemented with correct weights per Appendix A.1 formula
- All metrics normalized to [0.0, 1.0]
- quant_score = (RC × 0.30) + (IC × 0.25) + (SR × 0.15) + (DC × 0.15) + (SC × 0.15)
- Running twice on same input produces identical scores (deterministic)

**Validation:**
- Manual check: Compute expected RC for a test variant by hand, compare with engine output
- Evidence: Quantitative scoring table with raw counts and normalized scores for each variant

**Dependencies:** T03.07 (needs debate context), T02.05 (reuses contradiction detection)
**Rollback:** Revert scoring engine
**Notes:** —

### T04.02 — Implement qualitative scoring layer (25-criterion rubric)

**Roadmap Item ID(s):** R-022
**Why:** The qualitative layer provides LLM-assessed scoring across 5 dimensions with mandatory evidence citation, accounting for 50% of the final score.
**Effort:** `S`
**Risk:** `Low`
**Risk Drivers:** None matched
**Tier:** `STANDARD`
**Confidence:** `[██████████] 75%`
**Requires Confirmation:** No
**Critical Path Override:** No
**Verification Method:** Direct test execution
**MCP Requirements:** Preferred: Sequential, Context7
**Fallback Allowed:** Yes
**Sub-Agent Delegation:** None
**Deliverable IDs:** D-0025
**Artifacts (Intended Paths):**
- `.roadmaps/v1.7.0/artifacts/D-0025/spec.md`

**Deliverables:**
1. Qualitative rubric engine — evaluates variants across 25 binary criteria in 5 dimensions (completeness, correctness, structure, clarity, risk coverage); enforces CEV (Claim-Evidence-Verdict) protocol; qual_score = total_met / 25

**Steps:**
1. **[PLANNING]** Review spec Appendix A.2: all 25 criteria across 5 dimensions, CEV protocol
2. **[PLANNING]** Design evaluation prompt that enforces CEV format for every criterion
3. **[EXECUTION]** Implement 5-dimension evaluation: completeness (5 criteria), correctness (5), structure (5), clarity (5), risk coverage (5)
4. **[EXECUTION]** Enforce CEV protocol: CLAIM → EVIDENCE (direct quote or "No evidence found") → VERDICT (MET/NOT MET)
5. **[EXECUTION]** Implement default-to-NOT-MET rule: if evaluator cannot cite specific evidence for MET, defaults to NOT MET
6. **[VERIFICATION]** Verify CEV protocol is enforced — no MET verdicts without evidence citations
7. **[COMPLETION]** Qualitative scoring integrated with per-dimension tables

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 25 criteria evaluated per variant with binary MET/NOT MET verdicts
- Every MET verdict includes specific evidence citation (section reference or direct quote)
- CEV protocol strictly enforced — no evidence means NOT MET
- qual_score = total_criteria_met / 25, normalized to [0.0, 1.0]

**Validation:**
- Manual check: Verify at least 3 MET verdicts have valid evidence citations
- Evidence: Per-dimension scoring tables with CEV entries for each criterion

**Dependencies:** T03.07
**Rollback:** Revert rubric engine
**Notes:** —

### T04.03 — Implement position-bias mitigation

**Roadmap Item ID(s):** R-023
**Why:** Running qualitative evaluation twice (forward + reverse order) eliminates systematic position bias documented in LLM-as-judge research.
**Effort:** `S`
**Risk:** `Low`
**Risk Drivers:** None matched
**Tier:** `STANDARD`
**Confidence:** `[██████████] 75%`
**Requires Confirmation:** No
**Critical Path Override:** No
**Verification Method:** Direct test execution
**MCP Requirements:** Preferred: Sequential, Context7
**Fallback Allowed:** Yes
**Sub-Agent Delegation:** None
**Deliverable IDs:** D-0026
**Artifacts (Intended Paths):**
- `.roadmaps/v1.7.0/artifacts/D-0026/spec.md`

**Deliverables:**
1. Position-bias mitigation logic — dual-pass qualitative evaluation (forward + reverse variant order); disagreement detection and re-evaluation with comparison prompt

**Steps:**
1. **[PLANNING]** Review spec Appendix A.5 position-bias mitigation protocol
2. **[PLANNING]** Design dual-pass execution: Pass 1 (input order), Pass 2 (reverse order), comparison logic
3. **[EXECUTION]** Implement Pass 1: evaluate variants in input order (A, B, C, ...)
4. **[EXECUTION]** Implement Pass 2: evaluate variants in reverse order (..., C, B, A)
5. **[EXECUTION]** Implement disagreement resolution: if passes disagree on criterion, re-evaluate with explicit comparison prompt citing both passes' evidence
6. **[VERIFICATION]** Test with 2 variants — verify both passes run and disagreements resolved
7. **[COMPLETION]** Position-bias mitigation integrated into qualitative scoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Both forward and reverse passes execute for every qualitative evaluation
- Agreement: use agreed verdict; Disagreement: re-evaluate with comparison prompt
- Re-evaluation verdict is final (no further appeals)
- Dual-pass can execute in parallel for efficiency (forward + reverse simultaneously)

**Validation:**
- Manual check: Verify both passes are logged and any disagreements show re-evaluation
- Evidence: Bias mitigation log showing pass results and resolution decisions

**Dependencies:** T04.02
**Rollback:** Revert mitigation logic
**Notes:** —

**Deliverables:**
1. Combined scoring formula — `variant_score = (0.50 × quant_score) + (0.50 × qual_score)`; select highest-scoring variant as base

**Steps:**
1. **[PLANNING]** Review spec Appendix A.3 combined scoring formula
2. **[PLANNING]** Confirm input format: quant_score and qual_score both in [0.0, 1.0]
3. **[EXECUTION]** Implement combined formula: `(0.50 × quant_score) + (0.50 × qual_score)`

**Why:** E2E validation confirms the full pipeline works correctly with real input files in the compare-existing-files mode.
**Effort:** `S`
**Risk:** `Low`
**Risk Drivers:** end-to-end (+1)
**Tier:** `STANDARD`
**Confidence:** `[██████████] 75%`
**Requires Confirmation:** No
**Critical Path Override:** No
**Verification Method:** Direct test execution
**MCP Requirements:** Preferred: Sequential, Context7
**Fallback Allowed:** Yes
**Sub-Agent Delegation:** None
**Deliverable IDs:** D-0043
**Artifacts (Intended Paths):**
- `.roadmaps/v1.7.0/artifacts/D-0043/evidence.md`

**Deliverables:**
1. E2E Mode A validation results — complete pipeline run comparing 2-3 real markdown files; all 6 artifacts produced; return contract valid

**Steps:**
1. **[PLANNING]** Select 2-3 real markdown files with known differences for test input
2. **[PLANNING]** Define expected outcomes: all 6 artifacts produced, return contract populated
3. **[EXECUTION]** Run full pipeline: `/sc:adversarial --compare file1.md,file2.md --depth standard`
4. **[EXECUTION]** Verify all artifacts: diff-analysis.md, debate-transcript.md, base-selection.md, refactor-plan.md, merge-log.md, merged output
5. **[VERIFICATION]** Validate return contract: merged path exists, convergence score reasonable, status = success
6. **[COMPLETION]** E2E Mode A test results documented

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 6 artifacts produced in adversarial/ directory
- Return contract contains all 5 FR-007 fields with valid values
- Merged output is structurally valid (passes post-merge validation)
