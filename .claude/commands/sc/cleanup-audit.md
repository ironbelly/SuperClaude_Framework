# /sc:cleanup-audit - Multi-Pass Repository Audit

## Repository Context
- Total files: !`git ls-files | wc -l`
- File breakdown: !`git ls-files | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15`
- Repo size: !`du -sh . --exclude=.git --exclude=node_modules 2>/dev/null`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Last commit: !`git log --oneline -1`

## Target Scope
- Target: $ARGUMENTS
- Files in scope: !`find ${0:-.} -type f -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' | wc -l`
- File types: !`find ${0:-.} -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`

## Usage
```
/sc:cleanup-audit [target-path] [--pass surface|structural|cross-cutting|all] [--batch-size N] [--focus infrastructure|frontend|backend|all]
```

### Arguments
- **target-path**: Directory to audit (default: `.` for entire repo)
- **--pass**: Audit pass to run (`surface` = Pass 1, `structural` = Pass 2, `cross-cutting` = Pass 3, `all` = sequential 3-pass)
- **--batch-size**: Files per agent batch (default: 50 for surface, 25 for structural, 30 for cross-cutting)
- **--focus**: Domain filter for targeted auditing (`infrastructure`, `frontend`, `backend`, `all`)

## Behavioral Summary

Spawns parallel subagents in 3 escalating passes: Pass 1 (Haiku surface scan classifying files as DELETE/REVIEW/KEEP), Pass 2 (Sonnet structural audit producing mandatory 8-field per-file profiles), Pass 3 (Sonnet cross-cutting comparison producing duplication matrices with overlap percentages). Each pass uses evidence-gated classification requiring grep proof for every recommendation. Quality validated via spot-check sampling (10%). Reports written to `.claude-audit/`. Incremental checkpointing enables resume-from-checkpoint on session interruption.

## Examples

### Full Repository Surface Scan
```
/sc:cleanup-audit
```
Runs Pass 1 surface scan on the entire repository. Uses Haiku agents to classify every file as DELETE/REVIEW/KEEP. Produces per-batch reports and a consolidated summary at `.claude-audit/pass1-summary.md`.

### Structural Audit of Source Directory
```
/sc:cleanup-audit src/ --pass structural --batch-size 25
```
Runs Pass 2 structural audit on `src/` directory only. Produces mandatory 8-field profiles for each file. Requires Pass 1 results as input context. Validates per-file evidence quality.

### Infrastructure Cross-Cutting Sweep
```
/sc:cleanup-audit --pass cross-cutting --focus infrastructure
```
Runs Pass 3 cross-cutting comparison on infrastructure files (Docker, CI/CD, deploy scripts, configs). Produces duplication matrix with overlap percentages. Groups similar files for comparative analysis.

### Complete 3-Pass Audit
```
/sc:cleanup-audit --pass all --focus all
```
Runs all 3 passes sequentially with quality gates between each pass. Pass 1 inventory feeds Pass 2 deep audit, which feeds Pass 3 cross-cutting sweep. Produces final consolidated report with executive summary, prioritized action items, and discovered issues registry.

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Analyze every file in scope with evidence-backed classification (DELETE/CONSOLIDATE/MOVE/FLAG/KEEP)
- Produce machine-checkable reports with mandatory per-file profiles and verifiable grep citations
- Track coverage metrics and transparently report what was and was not audited

**Will Not:**
- Modify, delete, move, or rename any repository file during the audit
- Make assumptions from filenames alone — every classification requires reading content and tracing references
- Mark files as DELETE without grep proof of zero references and confirmed absence of dynamic loading

## CRITICAL BOUNDARIES

**READ-ONLY AUDIT — NO REPOSITORY MODIFICATIONS**

**Explicitly Will NOT**:
- Edit, delete, move, or rename any existing repository file
- Execute cleanup recommendations — human review gate is mandatory
- Modify CI/CD pipelines, configs, or any operational infrastructure
- Make speculative deletions based on filename patterns without evidence

**Output**: Audit reports written to `.claude-audit/` directory only:
- Per-batch reports (one per agent invocation)
- Per-pass summary reports (consolidated findings)
- Final report (executive summary + prioritized actions)
- progress.json (checkpoint state for resume capability)

**Next Step**: Use `/sc:cleanup` to execute safe recommendations, then `/sc:test` to verify no regressions, then `/sc:git` to commit changes.
